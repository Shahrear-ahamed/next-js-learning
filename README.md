### Nested Route

### Dynamic Route

Here i make a folder with the name of [Product]. then if i hit /product then inside product folder index.js file will be appear. after that if we set a file like this [productId].js then it will be dynamic route page. so now if we type /product/1 or product/100 however it is, this [productId].js page will be shown here.

Note That: On this [product] folder if we set any file and if we try to set like /product/food then this food.js file will be appear. if we search other things but this name file are not exist then this fill will be appear on dynamic file.
